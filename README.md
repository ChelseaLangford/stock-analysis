# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to creata a VBA script which analyzed the stock return percentage and total daily volume traded for a specific subset of stocks for a given year. My (hypothetical) client had a particular interest in one green energy company, in which his parents were considering investing. However, he was concerned that investing everything in a single company might not be a wise decision. To confirm his suspicions, my client asked for an easy way of comparing the stock return percentage for the years 2017 and 2018 for the company his parents were interested in, as well as a group of comparable green energy companies.

Once this script was created, it was determined that while the script ran efficiently when comparing the volume and return percentages for a set of 12 stocks, it might not be as quick when asked to run the analysis on a much larger data set, say, all publicly traded stocks in a given year. The second phase of this project involved refactoring the code to find a more efficient way of scanning through the daily volume and stock prices for each stock and generating the percent return from the ending price compared to the stock's starting price.
